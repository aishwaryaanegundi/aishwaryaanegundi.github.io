excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I started my career as an Application Developer with the Agile pioneers ThoughtWorks, where I groomed myself from being a coder to a developer with a good sense of clean coding and best development practices. Working on a project focusing on biometric data, I was introduced to various problems solvable by data science solutions. The enthusiasm to solve such a problem motivated me to continue my studies. 

I started my Master's studies at Saarland University, where I began with the core topics of Machine and Deep learning. My interest peaked in the application of Deep Learning, driving my studies of Computer Vision and Natural language Processing. 

The following year I started working as a Student Research Assistant at the Max Planck Institute of Informatics. It maked the beginning of my journey in Social Media Analysis. 

## Current Interests:

- Natural Language Understanding
- Neural Question Answering
- Computational Social Science
